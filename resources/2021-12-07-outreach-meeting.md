## General discussion

### Outreachy
Nick provided Ben and Shaun with a status of the Outreachy program and asked if they would be interested in getting involved. Ben suggested inviting current and past members of the Enarx project to be a guest speaker each week, sharing important insights with the Outreachy interns. Given the different timezones between guest speakers and interns, we'll likely have to create an asynchronous activity.
