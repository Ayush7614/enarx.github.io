Metrics are important to understand and grow a healthy open source community. These metrics may be related to the code base (number of issues, pull requests, etc), documentation (number of tutorials, accessibility, etc), discussions (engagement in chat, mailing lists, forums, etc), social media (followers and impressions in Twitter, LinkedIn, etc), or events (number of participants, demographics, etc).
