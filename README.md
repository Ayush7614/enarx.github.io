# Enarx

Project aim: Create a way to create and run "private, fungible, serverless" applications using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). In other words, to provide a platform abstraction for TEEs.

They should:

 * be confidential from the host and other workloads;
 * be able to run on
   * multiple silicon architectures; 
   * multiple server types;
   * public cloud or private cloud;
 * employ serverless deployment and execution mechanisms.

The mechanism itself should be capable of being FIPS-certified.

For more information, please try our [wiki](https://github.com/enarx/enarx.github.io/wiki), which includes further details on how to get more information.  It's also where we plan to keep up-to-date project information.

Building the various components of Enarx is currently complex: we are working on this.  Please contact us for help.
