# Introduction
The Confidential Computing Fellowship is a program being led by the Enarx project from the Confidential Computing Consortium from the Linux Foundation with the goal of bringing together early adopters of Confidential Computing and connecting them with mentorship/fellowship opportunities in this nascent and exciting new field. Confidential Computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
