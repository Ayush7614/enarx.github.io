## Outreachy

Outreachy is a diversity initiative from the Software Freedom Conservancy that provides paid, remote internships. Outreachy internships provide a stipend of $7,000 USD for full-time commitment that lasts 3 months. Past Outreachy interns include: 92% women, 4% transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary people, 64% people of color, and 12% people from a historically disadvantaged caste or tribe.

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. 

## Season of Docs

 Season of Docs provides support for open source projects to improve their documentation and gives professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source. Together we raise awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

## LFX Mentorship

LFX Mentorship makes it easy to sponsor and help train the next generation of open source developers by serving key needs of the community. LFX Mentorship is an initiative by the Linux Foundation.
